      <p class="tabrik">Dear Duncan! Working for a boss like you, who is so empathetic and kind, is no less than a blessing. You genuinely care for the people around you, and that is what makes you stand out as a person. Never had I seen you not giving a patient hearing to the issues faced by me or any other employee. This nature of yours makes you an extraordinary leader. Wishing you and your loved ones Merry Christmas!</p>
